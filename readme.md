### Hi, I'm Marvelous ðŸ‘‹ 
#### I'm a Front-end Devleoper.
With an understanding of
HTML 5, CSS 3, and JavaScript in conjuction with frameworks and libraries like React, Tailwind, Bootstrap, and Sass. I sculpt responsive and captivating interfaces that dance harmoniously across screens. Due to my curiosity about how applications evolve, I also studied UI/UX Design thus utilizing tools like Figma and Adobe-Xd so that I can bridge the gap between designers and developers
